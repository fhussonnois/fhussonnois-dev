### Hi, I'm Florian üëã

I‚Äôm a passionate open-source advocate for a long time, currently working as Lead Software Engineer at **[Kestra](https://kestra.io/)**. 

I worked for 12 years as a Software Engineer, Consultant, and Trainer specializing in stream processing architectures.

Throughout my career, I‚Äôve helped organizations build robust data streaming platforms and event-driven products, particularly leveraging Apache Kafka. 

As a long-time contributor to the open-source community, I‚Äôve co-organized the [Paris Apache Kafka Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Paris-Apache-Kafka-Meetup/) for several years and frequently speak on Kafka-related topics. 

My contributions include some Kafka Improvement Proposals (KIPs) for Kafka Streams, as well as the creation of open-source projects like **[Connect File Pulse](https://github.com/streamthoughts/kafka-connect-file-pulse)** and **[Jikkou](https://github.com/streamthoughts/jikkou)**.

For my work in the community, I was recognized as part of the [Confluent Community Catalyst](https://www.confluent.io/nominate/) program from 2019 to 2025.

Here are some projects, I'm currently working on üíª : 
 - [Kestra](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra)
 - [Jikkou](https://github.com/streamthoughts/jikkou)
 - [Azkarra Streams](https://www.azkarrastreams.io/)
 - [Connect File Pulse](https://github.com/streamthoughts/kafka-connect-file-pulse)
 - [Kafka Clients Kotlin](https://github.com/streamthoughts/kafka-clients-kotlin)
 - [Kafka Streams CEP](https://github.com/fhussonnois/kafkastreams-cep)
 
If you use or think that one of these projects can help you or your team to develop an application based on Kafka? Please üåü the repository to support my work!
