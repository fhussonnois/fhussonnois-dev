## 2024 

 * ### Paris Apache Kafka Meetup (France) : [Tool-In-Action: GitOps for Apache Kafka, at scale and with ease using Jikkou!](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/paris-apache-kafka-meetup/events/302715724/?eventorigin=group_events_list)


> **Abstract** : Kafka has become a central component for streaming data exchange in many companies, supporting a wide range of use cases such as data collection, integration, and processingâ€”often serving dozens of project teams. However, as these use cases grow in size and complexity, managing a Kafka platform can quickly turn into a nightmare. Manual configuration changes and updates must give way to an automation and orchestration strategy for deploying and managing associated resources (topics, schemas, ACLs, etc.). Additionally, the need often arises to introduce governance practices, track changes, and enable self-service access to the platform.
In this presentation, I invite you to discover Jikkou: an open-source framework that allows developers and DevOps teams to easily manage, automate, and provision all the resources needed for their Apache Kafka platform, all while adopting a Resource-as-Code approach!


## 2021

 * ### Kafka Summit Europe (Virtual) : [Writing Blazing Fast, and Production-Ready Kafka Streams apps in less than 30 min using Azkarra](https://www.confluent.io/events/kafka-summit-europe-2021/writing-blazing-fast-and-production-ready-kafka-streams-apps-in-less-than-30/)


> **Abstract** : If you have already worked on various Kafka Streams applications before, then you have probably found yourself in the situation of rewriting the same piece of code again and again. Whether it's to manage processing failures or bad records, to use interactive queries, to organize your code, to deploy or to monitor your Kafka Streams app, build some in-house libraries to standardize common patterns across your projects seems to be unavoidable. And, if you're new to Kafka Streams you might be interested to know what are those patterns to use for your next streaming project. In this talk, I propose to introduce you to Azkarra, an open-source lightweight Java framework that was designed to provide most of that stuffs off-the-shelf by leveraging the best-of-breed ideas and proven practices from the Apache Kafka community.
