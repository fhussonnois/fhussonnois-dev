Manipulating JSON data has become part of any engineerâ€™s daily routine. And, in todayâ€™s data-driven world, the ability to seamlessly transform and manipulate JSON data is essential for effective data integration and processing.
If youâ€™ve ever worked with data integration workflows, youâ€™ve probably already faced the need to find the right tool for the job!</description></item><item><title>Navigating Complexity: The Rise of Orchestration Platforms in a Disaggregated Software Architecture Landscape</title><link>https://www.streamthoughts.io/posts/2024-06-04-orchestration/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.streamthoughts.io/posts/2024-06-04-orchestration/</guid><description>This blog post was originally published on Medium
