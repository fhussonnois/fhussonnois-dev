Manipulating JSON data has become part of any engineer’s daily routine. And, in today’s data-driven world, the ability to seamlessly transform and manipulate JSON data is essential for effective data integration and processing.
If you’ve ever worked with data integration workflows, you’ve probably already faced the need to find the right tool for the job!</description></item><item><title>Navigating Complexity: The Rise of Orchestration Platforms in a Disaggregated Software Architecture Landscape</title><link>https://www.fhussonnois.dev/posts/2024-06-04-orchestration/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.fhussonnois.dev/posts/2024-06-04-orchestration/</guid><description>This blog post was originally published on Medium #The challenge to solve: The disaggregation of software architectures For some years now, software organizations have been facing what we might call &amp;ldquo;the disaggregation of software architectures&amp;rdquo;. All-in-one solutions, frameworks, and traditional databases have gradually given way to a multitude of more specialized solutions, each as complex as their predecessors, if not more.
The increasingly rapid and massive adoption of solutions from Cloud Providers has inevitably accelerated and reinforced this trend, fuelling the complexity of modern software architectures.</description></item><item><title>Why is Managing Kafka Topics Still Such a Pain?
